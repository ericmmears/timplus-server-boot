# Overview

The TIM+ server is a monolithic Spring Boot application which encapsulates a highly modified version of the Openfire XMPP Server.  The application contains both the core XMPP server that implements the TIM+ specification as well as a configuration web application that includes:

* Creating TIM+ domains
* Managing certificate and trust stores
* Creating and managing users
* Limiting operational monitoring  

This TIM+ Spring Boot server application is not intended to be full blown, production ready implementation. Instead it is a starting point from which a production system can be derived and deployed.
